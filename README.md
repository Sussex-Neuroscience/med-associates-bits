# Med Associates open source add ons and bits


 Med Associates sells a number of tools for behavioural systems. This commercial system is a complete solution for behavioural experiments, and can be used to run multiple behavioural boxes in parallel. It is unfortunately rather expensive and closed source, so users are almost always dependent on MedAssociates for upgrades and customization (and whenever something breaks). Another downside is that an unusual 28V system is employed, so adding/customizing things has an extra layer of complexity.

 This repository is a collection of bits, add-ons and some knowledge on the system we have gathered over the years.
